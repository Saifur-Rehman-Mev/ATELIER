🛍️ ATELIER — E-Commerce Web App
ATELIER is a modern e-commerce web application where users can browse products, authenticate, add items to their cart, and proceed through a secure payment flow 🛒💳.
The website is fully responsive and built using **TypeScript, React, and Supabase**, focusing on performance and a smooth shopping experience ⚡

A payment gateway is integrated, and some features are currently under development — such as allowing logged-in users to sell their own products and full Stripe payment integration 🚀
